                        This website serves as documentation of all labs 
                        and projects done during the Winter of 2022 in ME 405 -
                        Mechatronics. If you have any questions, please contact:

                        The majority of assignments are drivers on controlling
                        a motors to control a pen plotter that takes G code and
                        uses a sharpie to draw that picture.

   @subsection Task Diagram    Overview
                        This is a prototype of the main task diagram that will run our
                        program.

                        This is the high level task diagram that we plan to use to run
                        our program.
                        
   @subsection State Diagram   GCode FSM
                        This is a prototype of the FSM used to run the task for converting the
                        GCode into usable encoder coordinates for running our motors
